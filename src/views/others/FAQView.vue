        Staking / Unstaking / Delegating / Undelegating ?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body-1 pl-9">
        Staking is the same as Delegating.<br>
        Unstaking is the same as Undelegating.<br>
        In the Casper Network you Delegate (Stake) your token to a Validator (Node Operator).<br>
        A node operator is responsible to maintain correctly the node.<br>
        By staking your tokens on a validator node you will help securing the Network
        and you will receive rewards.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-3">
        Staking Rewards
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body-1 pl-9">
        Staking reward are payed every ERA (1 ERA is approximately 2 hours actually).<br>
        Once you have delegated your tokens you will receive the rewards at
        the end of the next ERA.<br>
        Actually there's no way to track easily the APY, but given the
        feedback from the community it's actually 20%~ (Per year).
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-3">
        Unstaking Delay
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body-1 pl-9">
        Once you have unstaked your tokens they will become available in your wallet in 7 ERA<br>
        (1 ERA is approximately 2 hours actually so approximately 14h)<br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-3">
        Security & Risk
      </h2>
      <p class="text-body-1 pl-9">
        You can unstake at any time<br>
        The Validator doesn't have access to your tokens.<br>
        Even if the Validator goes offline or is ejected from
        the auction you can unstake at any time.<br>
      </p>
